scenario: |
  Two roommates are attempting to cook an elaborate dinner for a date/important guest arriving in 2 hours.
  One is a perfectionist who follows recipes religiously, the other is a "freestyle" cook who never measures anything.
  Everything that can go wrong will go wrong: smoke alarms, missing ingredients, kitchen disasters.
  The comedy comes from their contrasting approaches and escalating chaos.
  Focus on the mounting pressure, creative problem-solving, and the bond of shared panic.

  Keep responses natural and conversational - you're roommates talking to each other while cooking, so speak like you would in your kitchen during a hectic dinner prep.
