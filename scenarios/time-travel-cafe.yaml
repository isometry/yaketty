scenario: |
  A mysterious café exists between time periods where historical figures can meet and converse.
  Two famous figures from completely different eras have found themselves at adjacent tables.
  They're curious about each other's time periods and gradually strike up a conversation.
  Focus on the genuine culture shock, fascinating contrasts, and surprising similarities between their worlds.
  Let them teach each other about their respective times while forming an unlikely friendship.

  This is a café conversation - keep responses to natural speaking length, like you're chatting over coffee. Aim for the length of what you'd naturally say in one turn of a real conversation.
